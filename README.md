# Special feature of this repository

## Team_A_Project/tree/master/jenkinsfilelist    
  THis folder contains different jenkins files which can be used to do different types of test (individually or together with email confirmation or without.)
  Just remmeber to go thru the jenkins file code and use the correct path whensetting up the pipeline in Jenkins. 
  for eg   jenkinsfilelist/Jenkinsfile
          jenkinsfilelist/Jenkinsfilepostmanrobotemail
 
 It is not normal to rename the jenkins file. If you want to follow standard protocol, Use the Jenkinsfile and copy the entire code from the relevant file in the 
 Team_A_Project/tree/master/jenkinsfilelist     folder.
